### What's in here:

- `bert_basic.ipynb`: A basic BERT classifier, used as baseline
- `bert_augmentation.ipynb`: Same BERT classifier but trained with augmented dataset
- `data_back_translation.ipynb`: The file used to created the augmented dataset. Note that because of time constraints I can only augment 200 samples. In the grand scheme of things it doesn't affect performance much
- `evaluation.ipynb`: Just to show the evaluation results

More info about implementation inside the notebooks themselves.
